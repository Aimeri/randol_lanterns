# Randolio: Lanterns

**ESX/QB/QBX supported**.

A halloween themed script that generates a set amount of randomized locations each restart from all 200 locations that are a part of the GTA Online Jack O'Lanterns event. I chose not to implement the trick or treat explode player functionality as it didn't seem that appropriate for RP.
